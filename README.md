# README for GitHub Repository - "Embodiment of power: People choose reward, but are attracted by power"

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the paper titled "Embodiment of power: People choose reward, but are attracted by power" by Chaigneau Amine, Borozan Miloš, Pezzullo Giovanni, De Liberato Simone, Palumbo Riccardo, and Iodice Pierpaolo. This repository contains the software used for the experiment, which is a web application.

## Important Note
Please be aware that the web application included in this repository has some outdated dependencies, including an older version of React.js and Material-UI. The Heroku endpoint for the application is currently disabled. If you wish to update and maintain this codebase, you are free to do so.

## Run the app

First run `npm i` to install dependencies, then builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Then, run `node server.js` on the console.

## More Recent Version
A more recent and improved version of the experimental code is available at [https://github.com/AmineChaigneau/EDMG-task-multiplayer](https://github.com/AmineChaigneau/EDMG-task-multiplayer). This newer version is designed to work in a multiplayer environment and utilizes a Django local back-end. We recommend checking out this repository for an updated and enhanced experience.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
